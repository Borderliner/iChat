###Installation
First, you must install `jade` via `sudo npm i -g jade`.<br>
Then `cd` into the root folder and issue `npm run jadeify` command.
This will compile all .jade files in public folder.<br>

###Starting the Server
You can start the server using `npm run start` command. To change
the port, edit package.json file, under "scripts", edit the "start" command
and change the port from the default (which is 3000) to whatever you want.
